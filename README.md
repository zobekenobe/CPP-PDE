# CPP-PDE
Brute force solver for PDEs using CPP. The basic structure is build upon matrices and accelerate the code with the use of concurrency and parallel programming. The use of advanced algorithms and data structures is abysmal and can't be ventured now. 

Contributions are sought towards this failing or even the inclusions of methods that haven't been explored.
